# developingakernelanddiskscheduling
This project consists of two components, one is developing a kernel and the other is implementing of disk scheduling algorithms. An operating system has many parts to it, with making oneâ€™s own operating system and understanding the flow of processes in the OS crucial in this project. Implementing the disk scheduling algorithm also helps understand how the OS deals with memory management of different processes and helps understand these algorithms better so that they may be used in a either a different scenario.
